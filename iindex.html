                <h2>My Story: </h2>
                    Hi there! I'm Sweata Chakraborty, and I would like to introduce myself 
                    as someone with a passion for programming and web development. During my 
                    time in class 11 and 12, I gained some experience in Python, which 
                    sparked my interest in the world of coding.

                    In my first year, I dived into the C language, and since then, I have been 
                    practicing C++ and exploring Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) alongside 
                    it. Recently, I have embarked on a journey into web development, having 
                    completed the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Currently, I'm gearing up to 
                    delve into JavaScript and explore various frameworks to enhance my web 
                    development skills.

                    In addition to my technical pursuits, I have also gained valuable experience 
                    in team working, leadership, and media handling during my second year. 
                    These skills have allowed me to effectively collaborate with others and 
                    take charge when necessary. Furthermore, I have a YouTube channel where 
                    I apply my creativity and skills in video editing.

                    I am excited about the endless possibilities that programming and web 
                    development offer and look forward to further honing my skills and 
                    contributing to exciting projects in the future.
